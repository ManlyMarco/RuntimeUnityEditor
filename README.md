# Runtime Unity Editor / Debugging Tools
In-game inspector, editor and interactive console for applications made with Unity3D game engine. It's designed for debugging and modding Unity games, but can also be used as a universal trainer. Runs under [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).

### Features
- Works on most games made in Unity 4.x or newer that use the mono runtime (IL2CPP is not supported at the moment)
- Minimal impact on the game - no GameObjects or Components are spawned (outside of the plugin component loaded by the mod loader) and no hooks are used (except if requested for profiler)
- GameObject and component browser
- Object inspector (allows modifying values of objects in real time) with clipboard
- REPL C# console with autostart scripts
- Simple Profiler
- Object serialization/dumping
- dnSpy integration (navigate to member in dnSpy)
- Mouse inspect (find objects or UI elements by clicking with mouse)
- Gizmos (Transform origin, Renderer bounds, Collider area, etc.)
- All parts are integrated together (e.g. REPL console can access inspected object, inspector can focus objects on GameObject list, etc.)
- and many other...

### How to use (BepInEx)
1. Install BepInEx v4.x or v5.x if you don't have it already. You can download it [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).
2. Download the latest BepInEx build (RuntimeUnityEditor_BepInEx5_vX.X.zip) from the [Releases](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor/releases) page. Make sure to get the correct version for your BepInEx.
3. Extract the BepInEx folder from the archive directly into your game directory (you should already have a BepInEx folder there from previous step). Replace files if asked.
4. To turn on press the F12 key when in-game. A window should appear on top of the game. If it doesn't appear, check logs for errors.

Note: If the plugin fails to load under BepInEx 4 with a type load exception, move RuntimeUnityEditor.Core.dll to BepInEx/core folder.

### How to use (Unity Mod Manager)
1. Install Unity Mod Manager if you don't have it already. You can download it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21). Select your game from the the dropdown list and then click the Install button.
2. Download the latest UMM build (RuntimeUnityEditor_UMM_vX.X.zip) from the [Releases](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor/releases) page.
3. Goto the Mods tab in Unity Mod Manager and drag the RuntimeUnityEditor zip file into the Unity Mod Manager GUI at the bottom where it says drop zip file here.
4. To turn on press the F12 key when in-game. A window should appear on top of the game. If it doesn't appear, check logs for errors.

### How to build
1. Get Visual Studio 2019 (or later).
2. Clone the repository recursively (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor`, VS 2022 can do it too). 
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio and hit Build All.

Notes:
- If you already have the repository cloned or want to update the mcs submodule you need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` on your local repository (if you have VS 2022 you can do it from the source control tab).
- An old version of UnityEngine.dll (pre-2017) is used for compatibility with all Unity versions 4.x and above, because the new UnityEngine.dll in 2017+ forwards all of the split types into their new respective dll files.
